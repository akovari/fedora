GitLab SPECS for Fedora
=======================

### An effort to package GitLab and its dependencies for Fedora.

Here I keep track of all the misssing gems from the Fedora repositories, as well
some that are submitted by [me][my_pkgs].

An unofficial repo is maintained [here][repo]. Currently there are packages for Fedora 19,
but the overall gitlab package is not finalized. Fedora 20 and rawhide packages
are scheduled, but it takes some time as I build all packages with mock in a chroot.

A wiki page with some useful information can be found [here][wiki].
